# 🎭 Multimodal Sentiment Analysis

This project focuses on **Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA)** — an advanced AI system that integrates **text, audio, image, and video data** to detect and classify human emotions with higher accuracy. Unlike unimodal models that rely on a single source of information, this system leverages the **fusion of multiple modalities** to capture both **linguistic intent** and **non-verbal cues** (facial expressions, vocal tones, and visual context).

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

* **Textual Analysis (NLP)**: Extracts sentiment from textual data such as speech transcripts, chat messages, and captions using transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa).
* **Audio Analysis (Speech Emotion Recognition)**: Analyzes tone, pitch, and rhythm to detect emotions such as happiness, anger, or sadness.
* **Visual Analysis (Computer Vision)**: Recognizes facial expressions from **images** and **video frames** using CNNs and pre-trained emotion recognition models.
* **Fusion Layer (Multimodal Integration)**: Combines insights from **all modalities** using attention-based fusion, ensuring the system captures both explicit and implicit emotional signals.
